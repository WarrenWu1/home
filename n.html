		of basketball itself, just as basketball shoes are the creation of basketball. The legends 
		created by countless great basketball players have become a great story among the fans, 
		and the sneaker equipment that accompanied them has been attached with a legend or 
		commemorative significance. Basketball shoes tell a legendary basketball story that has 
		developed a popular culture with its enormous influence.</p>
