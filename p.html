		<h1>Sneakers in the past</h1>
		<p>To really talk about the origin of sneaker culture, we have to go back to Converse rubber canvas shoes, 
		which were born in 1917. After several years of development, Converse Chuck Taylor All Star series became 
		the starting point of sneaker culture, which is why today's simple and seemingly ordinary rubber canvas 
		shoes are still one of the most popular shoes in this era.</p>
